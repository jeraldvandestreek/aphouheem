Hi all, I have an older gaming PC that I never use and I would like to turn this into a home server. But I don't really know what steps to take. The PC has the following specs: i7 4770 16gb ddr3 ram 120gb SSD and 3tb HDD GTX 770 500W power supply I know I don't need a dedicated graphics card so I'll remove that. Would there be anything else that needs changing? Its currently a midi tower, does that matter in any way? The home server will be used as a Plex server and file sharing. And maybe.

Hi ppl! I'm planning to build a small RTS engine prototype, like the old close combat games. I'm evaluating several languages and it's libraries right now, with Java being one of them. It's a language I'm proficient with (I've been working with it for 12 years), and the guy helping me, while being no professional developer, knows a bit of it. Performance is not really an issue because it's going to be a 2d game and I think current computers will handle the stress So im looking for games that i can enter a map, zone, instance, etc and just farm fot better loot to make my character stronger. Here is a list of some games that i played in this style: amp#x200B; Path of Exile Diablo Torchlight Grim Dawn amp#x200B; Thanks. Looking for a game with good swordplay mechanics, I've been playing vermintide 2 lately, but I find myself wanting more than what it has to offer. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. This has been an issue for about a week or two; my in game voice chat is totally disabled. I can't hear anyone or see the voice icons and I can't speak. What I've tried. - This whole link (https://support.ubi.com/en-US/faqs/000030829/In-game-Voice-Chat-Troubleshooting-R6/) (Yes really, everything.) - Disabled every playback/recording device except for my headset and restarted PC - Restarting audio service in services.msc - Changing audio settings in GameSettings.ini \ Pastebin

I'm open to selling the below for cash/gift cards/store credit and/or game trade offers for PC or Switch (and maybe PS4 or XB1, but not actively looking for much on these consoles at the moment). Feel free to PM if you'd like to make an offer; but please always leave a comment in this thread first  amp#x200B; My IGSRep Pages (prior trade rep on reddit): Rep Page 1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/5bbg79/auto_execs_igs_rep_page/), Rep Page 2 (https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep/co. I play on Xbox while in college because 1. I can’t afford to upgrade my PC and pay for college shit and 2. I leave my PC at home because it’s too much of a distraction. I would like to reserve a name for PC, even though I haven’t installed the game on PC. I’m sure those of you who care about name originality will understand this. Just wondering if you can. I would figure it out myself but I won’t be home near a computer until late this evening. I remember playing a game on my PC - it was an online game that was downloadable off some sort of platform like bigfishgames or something like that. The character was short (he might've had a female partner) and the character went around these really colourful 3D maze-type things collecting fruits. They weren't traditional mazes per say but made up of stairs that you went up and down? I believe collecting the fruit was the objective but am not really sure. Fruits were a very distinct 
Just curious. Since the update, playing the standard maps, the game will freeze and kick you out mostly in the final phase of the game and with a hero.
