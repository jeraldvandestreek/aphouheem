In previous FIFAs, there was a consistent way to finish chances (FIFA 12 across goal finesse, FIFA 13 near post power, FIFA 14 across goal power, FIFA 15 angled near post power or ground shot, FIFA 16 near post finesse), but in FIFA 17 it seems like there isn't 9 –¥–µ–∫ 2018  –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å—å –º–∞—Ç—á–∞ —Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∏—Ä–∞ PGL FIFA 19 CUP –≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫–∏ Gorilla –∏ F2Tekkz –û—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ—è–∑—ã—á–Ω–∞—è —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ª—è—Ü–∏—è.

This mode is seriously made to grind your gears, and its absolutely beautiful. I have always been a gold 3-2 player in past years weekend leagues, now even though im barely in division 4, im getting elite 3-2 Every single game is so hard, and im on edge of my seat. I have learned so much more in fifa19 than i have ever did in past series, only because im learning how to beat players around my skill point, until i climb, get smashed. 9 –¥–µ–∫ 2018  –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å—å –º–∞—Ç—á–∞ —Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∏—Ä–∞ PGL FIFA 19 CUP –≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫–∏ Gorilla –∏ Rogue Msdossary. –û—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ—è–∑—ã—á–Ω–∞—è.

Going overtime in most matches, now has to go back to his 20m squad. This is why competitive gaming shouldn't be in FUT, it's literally P2W. People that don't spend 100's of dollars on the game don't really have a chance to qualify for any of the EA tournaments (Besides maybe one or two exceptional players). We're talking about the best FIFA player in the world that lost 3 in 17 games without his multi-million squad.

I feel that the earlier your team become god-like, the bigger gap you will have for WL. The main reason Gorillaz was that good during early FIFA 18 was because of how he spend for FP. Once the game hit half-life, those team gaps will close up and you won't get the privilege of having best players in the team anymore. ESWC 2015 PGW @ Paris Games Week, 28.10.15 - 01.11.15. 
This is whats wrong with the pros in the game, unhappy but won't do anything about it because "ea won't listen" Kurt is saying they should take action, he is pretty much saying what everyone on reddit says about the game and Gorilla and Tass and Chu are laughing like "What is the point, nothing will get done" If they take action many will follow, they have thousands of followers, but they are too scared to say what they feel incase they are not invited to the next event This kid is playing TEXBOOX football. He knows when to play short, when to reset, when to play forward, when to switch. He skills, he takes long shots, he's playing the fun way. Not the typical safe way PTB - Counter Attack 1-2s with your STs till you find a trough ball and only score driven shots. No wonder, he's coached by an actual football coach. I'm sure he not only knows how to mash buttons and spam broken mechanics. By the way he plays you see he has a certain level of football Unilad gorilla beat DhTekKz twice this weekend and managed a 40-0. https://imgur.com/gallery/g2xF3. Tim latka who nearly never complains said in his most recent video that fifa 18 is inconsistent. He also says how are the pros supposed to adapt to the game if the game doesnt stay the same. Also he quit fut champs this month like many other pros. Edit: he quit because he cant get t100 monthly anyway and would rather play against pros and not have the inconsistent fut champs bullshit. I don't know whether it's because I love his videos so much, but his commentary is actually keeping me from clicking off the stream during boring match ups, it's like one huge Boras live stream. This guy is UNREAL and proved in this tournament why he's the best FIFA player currently. Smashed Deto 7-3 on aggregate. 3-3 on PS4 and 4-0 on Xbox One. ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶ç. he mentions this sub and how he goes through the sub every night, we love you Skillz ! (no homo) I like the test he did for the community, and that he spent 700k to prove something for us :) EDIT: He basically bought attribute cards for all his Elite players for the entire WL 40 matches. Anyone wanting to watch some top quality FIFA should be all over this stream, never seen attacking play so fluent, unreal player.
