This is part of a post (https://www.reddit.com/r/strife/comments/35c4b6/serious_transparency_the_future_of_strife/) originally made on r/strife (https://www.reddit.com/r/strife/) but it seems to me that it has a similar relevance on this subreddit.

Not many people have seen this, but this is an official mind map of the future features for rust, published by the dev's Enjoy. Similar to Garry's mind map for the future of Rust Garry's Mind Map: https://mind42.com/mindmap/7abd1334-d170-42e7-b869-f74010b9b143 Edit: This way we could see how far away some of our favorite changes would be speculated to be. This map could answer our reoccurring question: "When are milled cards going to be added to the log? Where is it on Team 5's Priority list?" Edit 2: this is an example of something that would be on the mind map: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7atpu0/be. Alright ladies and gents, as baseline draws nearer I think we should talk about plants, their uses, and our food options. This has been a topic of discussion I keep coming across that should be implemented (however primitively) in Rust baseline. This is just to get the discussion going and generate new ideas about upcoming features in rust. As someone who loves to camp and has taught basic survival (at a scout camp. It got real more than once) I believe plants are currently WAY under used. 
Honestly, i really wanted to post this for a time. You guys complain quite a lot. And i understand most of these complaints, so let's go. may the downvotes rain on me, i guess. I played 400h of rust. Some people may tell me that's nothing compared to 'my MLG 1700h noscope skills playthrough', i don't care. I think i can give my two cents already. Disclaimer before long text: this is not a clickbait, and i am a solo player. Ok. Rust has been there for a while. I didn't came in time for legacy. A while ago this mind map was released to give us an idea of the future of Rust: https://mind42.com/mindmap/7abd1334-d170-42e7-b869-f74010b9b143 Is there a more updated one floating around out there or can we get enough people to bother Garry and Helk for a newer one so we can have a better idea of what is planned for the future. This game can be absolutely brutal sometimes, and that's exactly what makes is so incredibly, heart-pumpingly fun. The sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter. I've never had my hands shake like they do when I'm in the high-risk high-reward situations of Rust. That being said, any game can get tiresome. One of my favorite things about Rust is taking several weeks off to come back and see all that has changed. Does it have problems? Yes.

The recent commotion we had with the throwaway pseudo-S2 accounts has got me thinking about why things like this are happening, and why there is so much general discontent among the denizens of Strife.

One common theme seems to be the lack of transparency. Frankly stated, we have no idea what the long term plan is, or if one even exists. 
gt PERSISTENCE IS OMNIPOTENT. “Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'press on' has solved and will always solve the problems of the human race.” - Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president of the United States. Nevertheles.

Jungle is one the most strategic lanes imo. It would be helpful for anyone starting to learn jungling. I'm not an expert jungler so I have to ask for the help of high level junglers to start this project. I also suggest doing this for every lane and make them(the mindmaps) accessible for newbies. Edit: Since everyone. I came across the minmap that Garry uses to keep track of ideas and what needs to be done. It's interesting to me that the game being unplayable on Linux doesn't even show up as an item on the map under bugs. I'm hoping this will stand out so Garry can comment on this. Garry, again I urge you not to ignore the Linux users, we paid you too. Also, I don't want to see any of you mention "Early Access". This has nothing Not sure if this is ok. This is an invitation for people who know more about this to make the final decisions on the languages and licenses.
